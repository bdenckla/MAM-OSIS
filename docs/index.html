<h1>
Features present</h1>
<h2>
Good endings (4 of them)</h2>
<p>Below is one of the 4 good endings. This one is at the end of Isaiah, whose last verse is 66:24. It repeats the verse before that (66:23) without pointing.</p>
<h2>
Scroll difference notes (29 of them)</h2>
<p>Below is one of the 29 scroll difference notes. This one is in Exodus 25:31. It is noting the presence of a malei (full) spelling (note the yod) in scrolls of the Ashkenazic and Sephardic traditions. (This is as opposed to the ḥaser (“deficient”) spelling in MAPM’s body text.)</p>
<h2>
Ketiv/qere, ketiv velo qere, &amp; qere velo ketiv</h2>
<h3>
Ketiv/qere</h3>
<p>Below are three examples of ketiv/qere. The first is from 1Kgs.1.37.</p>
<p>The second is from 1Kgs.1.27. It shows how qere-then-ketiv ordering is used when the qere is at the end of a maqaf compound.</p>
<p>The third is from Isa.26.20 and shows how the ketiv is separated from the qere by a maqaf instead of a space when the qere is in the middle of a maqaf compound. (This is one of only two cases where this awkward situation happens.)</p>
<h3>
Ketiv velo qere</h3>
<p>This is where the ketiv word has no qere counterpart. These are only 8 cases of ketiv velo qere.  Below are two examples. The first is from Ezekiel 48:16.</p>
<p>The second is from 2 Samuel 13:33. It is one of the two special cases of ketiv velo qere where a maqaf is appended, since the ketiv velo qere appears in the middle of a maqaf compound.</p>
<p>In MAPM, ketiv velo qere isn’t implemented as a feature independent of normal ketiv/qere, but we still decided to list it here as a feature that is present rather than missing. It would perhaps be more clearly present if ketiv velo qere were presented more explicitly, i.e., more distinctly from a ketiv that is part of a normal ketiv/qere. As it is, ketiv velo qere is only presented implicitly: it can be distinguished from a ketiv that is part of a normal ketiv/qere only by the fact that there is no adjacent qere in square brackets.</p>
<h3>
Qere velo ketiv</h3>
<p>This is the “dual” of ketiv velo qere. There are only 9 cases of qere velo ketiv. Below is an example from 2Kgs.19.31.</p>
<h2>
Parashot setumot &amp; petuḥot, each of types 1 &amp; 2</h2>
<p></p>
<h2>
Shirah spaces</h2>
<p>In MAPM, a shirah space looks just like a parashah setumah of type 2. So, as with other features we’ve seen, perhaps I’ve been a bit optimistic to consider this feature present rather than absent. Here’s what the start of Exodus 15 (“Az Yashir” aka “Song at the Sea”) looks like (it is full of shirah spaces):</p>
<h2>
Inverted nun markers (Numbers 10 &amp; Psalm 107 types)</h2>
<p>Inverted nun markers are used in two places: Numbers 10 and Psalm 107. Here are the Numbers 10 cases, in which the inverted nun markers “bracket” the span from the start of verse 35 to the end of verse 36 (the end of the chapter):</p>
<p>Here are the Psalm 107 cases, in which the inverted nun markers “introduce” verses 23 thru 28, and verse 40 (shown in one-verse-per line mode to make this clearer):</p>
<h2>
Paseq marks (as distinct from legarmeih marks)</h2>
<p>In MAPM, unlike any other edition of MAM, legarmeih is distinguished from paseq by having each paseq followed by a note reading פסק ולא לגרמיה (paseq velo legarmeih, i.e. "paseq and not legarmeih"). Lev.10.6 shows both marks in close proximity:</p>
<h2>
Hung letters</h2>
<p>Although MAPM is missing the feature of small &amp; large letters (see below), the feature of hung (aka suspended) letters is present. For example, in Judges 18:30, we find one of the four hung letters in MAM:</p>
<h1>
Features absent</h1>
<h2>
Small &amp; large letters</h2>
<p>Compare this ketiv/qere from Job.7.5 as rendered in MAPM (via xulsword) vs. MAM-WS (MAM on Hebrew Wikisource):</p>
<p>Ignoring the different way ketiv/qere is presented on MAM-WS, note that the gimel in the ketiv is small.</p>
<p>That is actually the only example of a special letter in a ketiv. Daniel 6:20 provides an example of two special letters in a normal word. The first pe is small and the second pe is large:</p>
<h2>
“A” and “B” cantillations</h2>
<p>Like many editions of MAM, MAPM does not show "A" and "B" cantillations. By "A" and "B" I mean the two single-strand cantillations corresponding to dually-cantillated sections. These sections are the Exodus and Deuteronomy decalogues, and Genesis 35:22. So, for example, MAPM only shows the dual-stranded version of this phrase from Gen.35.22:</p>
<p>Whereas MAM-WS shows not only the dual-stranded version but also the "A" and "B" cantillations, which it refers to as the פשוטה (pashutah)  and מדרשית (midrashit) cantillations respectively:</p>
<h2>
Implicit maqaf marks</h2>
<p>Compare the maqaf in this maqaf compound in Job.3.4 in MAPM vs MAM-WS:</p>
<p>Note that the maqaf in MAM-WS is gray. This notes that this maqaf is supplied by MAM, although no such maqaf present in the manuscript MAM is based on (the Aleppo Codex).</p>
